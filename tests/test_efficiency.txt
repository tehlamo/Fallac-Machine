The quarterly meeting begins at nine and the agenda is limited to two items: the release timeline and the support handover. The current prototype passes all critical checks, so we can ship when the translation files finalize. Please prepare the deployment checklist and confirm the rollout window with operations. There is no reason to rush or delay if the readiness criteria remain stable.
